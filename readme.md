# Car Tracking
This is a console implementation of the program designed to track objects in user's interest.

**OpenCV** library was used to define an object for tracking. This process can be done in two ways:
1) by defining width, length and position of the bounding box inside code (line 66),
2) with drawing a bounding box by the user on the screen and pressing Enter/Spacebar (line 67).

**car_passing_by.mp4** is an input sample video for the program to work with.
